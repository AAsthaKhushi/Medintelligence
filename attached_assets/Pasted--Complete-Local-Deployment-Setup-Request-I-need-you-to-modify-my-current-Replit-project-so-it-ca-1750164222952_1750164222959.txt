# Complete Local Deployment Setup Request

I need you to modify my current Replit project so it can run seamlessly on a local machine. Please make ALL necessary changes to ensure someone can simply download the zip file and run the project locally without any configuration issues.

## Required Changes:

### 1. Environment Variables Setup
- Create a `.env` file in the root directory
- Move all environment variables from Replit Secrets to the `.env` file
- Include these variables (replace with your actual values):
  ```
  DATABASE_URL=your_database_url_here
  OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
  PORT=3000
  NODE_ENV=development
  ```
- Add any other environment variables your project uses
- Create a `.env.example` file showing the required variables (without actual values)

### 2. Package.json Updates
- Ensure all dependencies are properly listed in `package.json`
- Add proper start scripts:
  ```json
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",
    "dev": "nodemon server.js",
    "install": "npm install"
  }
  ```
- Include `nodemon` as a dev dependency if not already present
- Verify all imported packages are included in dependencies

### 3. Configuration Files
- Create or update any necessary config files
- Ensure database connection code works with local environment
- Update any hardcoded Replit URLs to use environment variables or localhost
- Add proper error handling for missing environment variables

### 4. File Structure & Dependencies
- Verify all file paths are correct and use relative paths
- Check that all required files are present
- Ensure no Replit-specific code remains that would break locally
- Add any missing middleware or setup code

### 5. Documentation
- Create a `README.md` file with:
  - Installation instructions
  - Environment setup steps
  - How to run the project locally
  - Any prerequisites (Node.js version, database setup, etc.)
  - Troubleshooting common issues

### 6. Database Setup
- Include database schema/migration files if needed
- Add instructions for database setup in README
- Ensure connection string format works for local databases

### 7. Additional Requirements
- Add `.gitignore` file to exclude node_modules, .env, and other unnecessary files
- Remove any Replit-specific files that aren't needed locally
- Test that the project structure is complete and self-contained

## Final Checklist:
- [ ] `.env` file created with all necessary variables
- [ ] `package.json` has all dependencies and proper scripts
- [ ] No hardcoded Replit URLs or paths
- [ ] Database connection works with local setup
- [ ] All imports and file paths are correct
- [ ] README.md with clear setup instructions
- [ ] `.gitignore` file present
- [ ] Project can run with just `npm install` and `npm start`

## Expected Outcome:
After these changes, someone should be able to:
1. Download the zip file
2. Extract it
3. Run `npm install`
4. Create/configure the `.env` file with their values
5. Run `npm start`
6. Have the website working locally

Please make all these changes and ensure the project is completely ready for local deployment. Double-check that no Replit-specific dependencies or configurations remain.
