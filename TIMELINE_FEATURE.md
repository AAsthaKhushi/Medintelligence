# MedIntelligence Medication Timeline Feature

## Overview

The Medication Timeline feature provides a comprehensive medication management system that helps users track, schedule, and manage their medications effectively. It includes intelligent scheduling, conflict detection, and adherence tracking.

## Features

### 1. Smart Medication Scheduling
- **Frequency Parsing**: Automatically parses medication frequencies (BID, TID, QID, etc.) into specific time slots
- **Custom Timing**: Supports custom time patterns and meal-based scheduling
- **Interval-based Dosing**: Handles medications with specific hour intervals
- **PRN Medications**: Special handling for "as needed" medications

### 2. Timeline Visualization
- **24-Hour View**: Daily timeline showing all medication slots
- **Color-coded Status**: Visual indicators for taken, missed, upcoming, and skipped medications
- **Conflict Highlighting**: Clear identification of medication conflicts
- **Meal Time Integration**: Automatic meal time indicators (breakfast, lunch, dinner)

### 3. Conflict Detection & Resolution
- **Timing Conflicts**: Detects overlapping medication schedules
- **Food Requirement Conflicts**: Identifies conflicts between "with food" and "empty stomach" requirements
- **Drug Interactions**: Basic drug interaction checking (expandable with external APIs)
- **Severity Levels**: Critical, severe, moderate, and minor conflict categorization

### 4. Medication Status Tracking
- **Real-time Updates**: Mark medications as taken, missed, or skipped
- **Notes System**: Add notes to medication actions
- **Adherence Tracking**: Calculate and display adherence rates
- **Overdue Alerts**: Visual indicators for missed medications

### 5. Advanced Features
- **Schedule Optimization**: AI-powered schedule optimization suggestions
- **Export Functionality**: Export medication schedules
- **Filtering & Search**: Filter by prescription, priority, or status
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface

## Technical Architecture

### Database Schema

#### New Tables
1. **medication_schedules**: Stores generated medication schedules
2. **medication_status**: Tracks medication administration status
3. **medication_conflicts**: Records detected medication conflicts

#### Enhanced Tables
1. **prescriptions**: Added timeline-specific fields
2. **medicines**: Added timing instructions and priority levels

### Frontend Components

#### Core Components
- `TimelineHeader`: Date navigation and filter controls
- `TimelineDisplay`: Main 24-hour timeline view
- `MedicationCard`: Individual medication display and actions
- `ConflictPanel`: Conflict display and resolution

#### Utilities
- `timeline-utils.ts`: Core scheduling and conflict detection logic
- `useTimeline.ts`: React hook for timeline state management

### Backend API

#### Timeline Endpoints
- `GET /api/timeline/schedules`: Get schedules for a specific date
- `GET /api/timeline/status`: Get medication status for a date
- `PUT /api/timeline/status/:scheduleId`: Update medication status
- `GET /api/timeline/conflicts`: Get medication conflicts
- `POST /api/timeline/generate-schedules`: Generate schedules for a prescription
- `POST /api/timeline/optimize`: Optimize medication schedule

## Usage Guide

### Setting Up the Timeline

1. **Database Migration**: Run the migration script to create timeline tables
   ```sql
   psql -d your_database -f server/migrations/add_timeline_tables.sql
   ```

2. **Access the Timeline**: Navigate to `/timeline` in the application

3. **Generate Schedules**: For existing prescriptions, use the "Generate Schedules" feature

### Using the Timeline

#### Daily View
- Navigate between days using the date picker or arrow buttons
- View all medications scheduled for the selected day
- Expand time slots to see detailed medication information

#### Medication Actions
- **Mark as Taken**: Click the green "Taken" button and optionally add notes
- **Mark as Missed**: Click the red "Missed" button for overdue medications
- **Mark as Skipped**: Click the gray "Skip" button to skip a dose

#### Conflict Resolution
- Review conflicts in the right sidebar
- Follow suggested resolutions for each conflict
- Use the "Optimize Schedule" feature for AI-powered suggestions

### Frequency Patterns Supported

| Pattern | Description | Example |
|---------|-------------|---------|
| BID | Twice daily | "Take 2 tablets twice daily" |
| TID | Three times daily | "Take 1 tablet three times daily" |
| QID | Four times daily | "Take 1 tablet four times daily" |
| QD | Once daily | "Take 1 tablet daily" |
| PRN | As needed | "Take as needed for pain" |
| Interval | Every X hours | "Take every 6 hours" |
| Custom | Specific times | "Take at 8 AM and 8 PM" |

## Configuration

### Priority Levels
- **Critical**: Life-sustaining medications (highest priority)
- **High**: Important medications requiring strict adherence
- **Medium**: Standard medications (default)
- **Low**: Optional or supplementary medications

### Administration Routes
- **Oral**: Tablets, capsules, liquids
- **Topical**: Creams, ointments
- **Injection**: Subcutaneous, intramuscular
- **Inhalation**: Inhalers, nebulizers
- **Sublingual**: Under the tongue

## Future Enhancements

### Planned Features
1. **AI Integration**: Enhanced schedule optimization using GPT-4
2. **Drug Database**: Integration with comprehensive drug interaction databases
3. **Notifications**: Push notifications for medication reminders
4. **Analytics**: Detailed adherence analytics and reports
5. **Family Management**: Support for managing family members' medications

### API Integrations
1. **Drug Interaction APIs**: Real-time drug interaction checking
2. **Pharmacy APIs**: Direct prescription refill requests
3. **Healthcare Provider APIs**: Direct communication with doctors
4. **Insurance APIs**: Coverage and cost information

## Security & Privacy

### Data Protection
- All medication data is encrypted at rest
- User authentication required for all timeline operations
- HIPAA-compliant data handling practices
- Regular security audits and updates

### Privacy Features
- User-controlled data sharing
- Anonymized analytics (optional)
- Secure data export and deletion
- Audit trails for all medication actions

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### No Medications Showing
- Ensure prescriptions have been processed successfully
- Check that medications have frequency information
- Verify the selected date has scheduled medications

#### Schedule Generation Fails
- Check medication frequency format
- Ensure prescription dates are valid
- Verify database connection and permissions

#### Conflicts Not Detected
- Ensure medications have proper timing instructions
- Check that conflict detection is enabled
- Verify drug interaction database connectivity
